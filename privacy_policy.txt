Privacy Policy

The MKW-Wiimmfi-Status-Bot only collects Discord Channels or Users ID's in order to send them notifications when they asked the bot to be notified.
Those ID's are a publicly available number to any user of the Discord app/website.
As soon as the user asks the bot to stop sending notifications (with the appropriate command),
	or when it is not possible to send them messages anymore (because of a channel deletion,
	or the user blocked the bot or removed it from their server),
	its user ID is deleted from its database.
If, for any reason, you were unable to unsubscribe to such notifications,
	feel free to contact us (Artesian Dream#9970 on Discord or by email to antoinewright95@gmail.com) so that we remove your ID from our database.
