Privacy Policy

The MKW-Wiimmfi-Status-Bot only collects Discord Channels or Users ID's in order to send them notifications when they asked the bot to be notified.
Those ID's are a publicly available number to any user of the Discord app/website.
As soon as the user asks the bot to stop sending notifications (with the appropriate command),
	its user ID is deleted from its database.
If, for any reason, you were unable to unsubscribe to such notifications,
	feel free to contact us (opale95|antoinewright95@gmail.com) so that we remove your ID from our database.
